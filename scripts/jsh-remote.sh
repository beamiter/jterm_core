# vendored from https://github.com/beamiter/jsh -> scripts/jsh-remote.sh
# Keep this copy in sync with that file; every jterm embeds it with
# include_str! so a remote host can get a jsh without one being installed.
# Run jsh on a machine that does not have jsh installed.
#
#   jsh-remote.sh build-box
#   jsh-remote.sh --incognito root@10.0.0.7
#   jsh-remote.sh --docker my-container
#
# A static musl jsh is placed on the destination, executed, and taken away
# again. The destination keeps its own shell: nothing here edits .bashrc,
# .profile, .zshrc, /etc/profile.d, or the login shell in /etc/passwd, and
# nothing needs root or a package manager. Other users of that machine cannot
# tell this ran.
#
# Two modes, because "do not install anything" means two different things:
#
#   --persist (default)  jsh keeps its own dot-files in your remote $HOME
#                        (~/.jsh_history, ~/.jsh/) and caches the binary under
#                        ~/.cache, so history and frecency survive and repeat
#                        connections skip the transfer. Private permissions,
#                        your account only.
#
#   --incognito          HOME points at a sandbox that is deleted when the
#                        session ends. Your real remote $HOME is never written
#                        to, which is what a shared account needs. The price is
#                        a fresh transfer each connection and no history across
#                        sessions.
#
# Design notes that are easy to get wrong and expensive to rediscover:
#   * Nothing is downloaded on the destination. The artifact is fetched and
#     verified *here* by install-jsh.sh --stage-dir, then pushed over the
#     transport, so an air-gapped host works and there is still exactly one
#     copy of the download-and-verify logic.
#   * musl only. A static binary has no glibc floor, so one artifact per
#     architecture covers Alpine, ancient CentOS, and everything between.
#   * Sandboxes are created with mktemp -d, never with a predictable name, so
#     nothing in a world-writable /tmp can be pre-created by another user and
#     written through.
#   * The binary cache lives under $HOME and nowhere else. Only its owner can
#     write there, which is what makes reusing a fixed path safe at all.
#   * Cleanup cannot run on the destination: the session ends in exec(), which
#     replaces the shell that would have carried the trap. The local side tears
#     down when the transport returns, and any sandbox orphaned by a crash is
#     swept by the next connection.

Usage: jsh-remote.sh [options] <destination> [-- <extra ssh args>]

Destination:
  <destination>        ssh destination, [user@]host
  --docker CONTAINER   a running container instead of an ssh host
  --docker-user USER   run as USER inside the container

Modes:
  --persist            (default) jsh keeps its dot-files in your remote $HOME
                       and caches the binary there; history survives, repeat
                       connections skip the transfer
  --incognito          sandboxed HOME, wiped when the session ends; your real
                       remote $HOME is never written to

Options:
  --version VERSION    jsh release to deploy (default: the local jsh's version)
  --artifact FILE      push this binary instead of fetching a release
  --session ID         pass --session ID to the remote jsh
  --rcfile FILE        push FILE and start from it (default in --incognito:
                       ~/.jshrc here, else the destination's ~/.bashrc)
  --no-rc              start with --norc
  --fallback MODE      when deployment is impossible: bash (default) or fail
  --no-deploy          never push; use a jsh already on the destination or fall
                       back
  --keep-sandbox       leave the sandbox behind (debugging)
  --dry-run            probe and print the plan, deploy nothing
  -v, --verbose        narrate each step
  -h, --help           Show this help

Everything after `--` is passed to ssh. It is split on whitespace, so an
argument containing a space has to go through JSH_REMOTE_SSH_ARGS instead.

Environment:
  JSH_REMOTE_SSH_ARGS         extra ssh arguments
  JSH_REMOTE_ARTIFACT_CACHE   verified artifacts for other machines
  JSH_INSTALL_BASE_URL        release base URL, honoured by install-jsh.sh
