# vendored from https://github.com/beamiter/jsh -> scripts/install-jsh.sh
# Keep this copy in sync with that file; every jterm embeds it with
# include_str! so a machine without jsh can still bootstrap one.
# Install or update jsh for the current user.
#
#   curl -fsSL https://github.com/beamiter/jsh/releases/latest/download/install-jsh.sh | sh
#
# The script is the single source of truth for "how jsh gets onto a machine":
# All four terminals shell out to it instead of each carrying their own installer.
#
# Design notes that are easy to get wrong and expensive to rediscover:
#   * Every binary this script touches is identified by its `--version` banner,
#     never by its name alone: a `jsh` on PATH need not be this shell.
#   * The binary is replaced by rename(2), so shells that are already running
#     keep the inode they started with and are never disturbed.
#   * Nothing here edits shell startup files. If PATH resolves to the wrong jsh
#     we say so and print the fix; we do not silently rewrite the user's config.
#   * `--stage-dir` stops after "downloaded and verified", so jsh-remote.sh can
#     ship a binary to a machine that has no network without growing a second
#     copy of the download-and-verify logic.
#   * A source build prefers the checkout this script is run from, uncommitted
#     work included. Building the last pushed commit instead would quietly
#     install something other than the tree the user is standing in. Piped from
#     curl there is no checkout to find, and the repository build takes over.

    cat <<'USAGE'
Usage: install-jsh.sh [options]

Options:
  --check              Report installed and latest versions, then exit
  --json               Machine-readable output (human text goes to stderr)
  --max-age SECONDS    With --check, reuse a cached result younger than this
  --version VERSION    Install an exact version instead of the latest
  --tag TAG            Same, spelled as a tag (v0.2.0)
  --channel CHANNEL    source (cargo build, default) or release (prebuilt).
                       Staging always uses release. An explicit release that
                       finds no published release falls back to source and
                       says so
  --source-dir PATH    Build this checkout, uncommitted work included. Defaults
                       to the checkout this script lives in, when there is one
  --git                Build the published repository even when the script is
                       run from a checkout
  --prefix PATH        Install root; binary lands in PATH/bin
  --bin-dir PATH       Install directory for the binary (overrides --prefix)
  --target TRIPLE      Fetch for this target instead of the detected one
  --stage-dir PATH     Download and verify only; leave the binary in PATH and
                       exit without installing anything
  --force              Reinstall even when the wanted version is present
  --dry-run            Print what would happen, change nothing
  -h, --help           Show this help

Default install directory: the directory of the jsh already on PATH when it is
writable, otherwise ~/.local/bin.

Environment:
  JSH_INSTALL_BASE_URL  Release base URL (mirrors, local testing)
  JSH_INSTALL_TARGET    Force a target triple instead of detecting one
  XDG_CACHE_HOME        Update-check cache base (default ~/.cache)
  XDG_STATE_HOME        Rollback copy base (default ~/.local/state)
